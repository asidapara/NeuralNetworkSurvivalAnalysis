# NeuralNetworkSurvivalAnalysis
Extension of Differential Community Analysis Project

There is a Matlab file that essentially was autogenerated using the NN toolkit. It has specific weights, assigned by using the Levenberg-Marquardt Training Algorithm. 

There is also an R file that is the function I used for mapping drugs to the significant nodes. 

DatasetResults.zip contains all my results from the DiffComm analysis.
