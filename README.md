# NeuralNetworkSurvivalAnalysis
Extension of Differential Community Analysis Project

This repository contains both my neural network and the drug matching extension. 

There is a Matlab file that essentially was autogenerated using the NN toolkit. It has specific weights, assigned by using the Levenberg-Marquardt Training Algorithm. 

There is also an R file that is the function I used for mapping drugs to the significant nodes. 

DatasetResults.zip contains all my results from the DiffComm analysis. 

NNDataTrainingSet.zip contains the training data I used for the neural networks. 

interactions.tsv is a drug database I got from the WUSTL Drug Gene Interaction DB (DGIdb).
